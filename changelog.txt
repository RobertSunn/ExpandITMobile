Date         User       Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2014-12-15   RSP        Fixed a bug in PEMP/include/weblogic_online.asp, causing local changes to risk being
                        deleted, in case of an out-of-sync situation when doing a quick-sync

2014-11-23   RSP        Fixed a bug with smtp authentication in the BAS e-mail functionality

2014-11-21   RSP        Fixed a bug in the change collation code

2014-10-31   RSP        Added client->server tables for inspect + yellow background color on mismatches in data.
                        (Pending commits and pending synchronization)

2014-09-19   RSP        Added a checkbox to control if 2-way synchronization should be enabled when adding
                        tables or running a check DB. The default is "yes", so if the BAS ASP code is updated with
                        this on an existing or upgraded solution, the user should uncheck the checkbox to keep the 
                        current behavior of the system. If enabled, all Client->Server tables should get a filter
                        added to prevent all historical data from being synchronized to all clients.

2014-09-02   RSP        Modules/emsm_NewServiceOrder/*
                        Changed editing of existing service orders to create new records with RecordAction='MODIFY'

2014-07-17   RAN        Modules/OrderApproval/OrderList.asp
                        HT changed to H and several H applied.
                        Modules/emsm_serviceorders/OrderListASP.asp
                        Minor change to handle empty BASGuid. 

2014-06-25   RAN        Modules/emsm_NewServiceOrder/
                        Alternative shipping addresses did not work as some of the guid's had empty spaces in them. Fixed.
                        It is now possible to easily add BillTo to be the same as the current customer (NEW had issues here).
                        Minor modifications to UI.
                        Pop-up dialog has been modified in with to fix narrower screens better.

2014-06-25   RAN        Modules/Customers/CustomerZoom.asp
                        The "Country" filed was a simple text field. Modified to be anactual drop down with countires.
                        This corresponds with selecting customer when creating service orders.                                

2014-06-23   RAN        Modules/emsm_NewServiceOrder/_NewServiceOrder.asp
                        The line "dictServiceOrder.client_guid = CLng(Timer() * 100 + Rnd() * 2000000)" has been commented out.
                        client_guid is maintiand by internal BAS code and should not be set in normalt code.                            
                         
2014-06-23   RAN        Introduced this readme :-)
